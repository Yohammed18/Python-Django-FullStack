    <h1>Welcome to your First Exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p>
        We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to kilogram (kg). Right now we only know enought to do
        this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problems!
    </p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Link this HTML file to your own .js file</li>
        <li>Use Javascript to accept a number input in pounds (lbs).</li>
        <li>Then in your js file cpmvert this number in kilograms (*0.454).</li>
        <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight in kg.</li>
